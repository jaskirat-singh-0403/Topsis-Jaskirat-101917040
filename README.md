# TOPSIS
## Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)

Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) came in the 1980s as a multi-criteria-based decision-making method. TOPSIS chooses the alternative of shortest the Euclidean distance from the ideal solution and greatest distance from the negative ideal solution. 

TOPSIS is a way to allocate the ranks on basis of the weights and impact of the given factors:. 

- Weights mean how much a given factor should be taken into consideration
- Impact means that a given factor has a positive or negative impact.

This tool allows you to calculate the topsis ranking and save the results in the form of a csv (Comma Seperated Value) file.
